Integration with Google GenerativeAI's Gemini model
Textual response display
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
Google GenerativeAI API access (obtain API key)
Pillow (pip install Pillow)
dotenv (pip install python-dotenv) (optional, for managing API key)
Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-to-text-converter.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (create requirements.txt if not present)
Set up Google GenerativeAI API key:

Upload an image and optionally provide a text prompt.
Click the "Do the magic..." button to initiate text generation.
The generated text will be displayed beneath the "The response is:" subheader.
Notes:

Ensure your Google GenerativeAI API key is valid and has appropriate permissions.
